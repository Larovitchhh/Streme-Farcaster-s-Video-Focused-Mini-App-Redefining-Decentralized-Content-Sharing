To use Streme, users need a Farcaster account, which can be created at farcaster.xyz. Once signed in, they can access Streme at https://farcaster.xyz/streme or streamm.xyz within a Farcaster client like Recaster. The app’s interface likely guides users through uploading, viewing, or streaming videos, with options to secure content using keys. Developers interested in building similar Mini Apps can explore Farcaster’s documentation at docs.farcaster.xyz or join the /fc-devs channel for community support.
