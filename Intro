Farcaster, a decentralized social network built on Ethereum, empowers users with ownership over their accounts, relationships, and data while fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovative applications. At the core of this ecosystem are Mini Apps, lightweight web-based applications built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrate seamlessly into Farcaster clients, leveraging features like authentication, notifications, and wallet interactions. One such Mini App, Streme (accessible at https://farcaster.xyz/streme), reimagines video content sharing within Farcaster, offering a YouTube-like experience with support for private videos and live streams secured by cryptographic keys. This article explores Stremeâ€™s functionality, its role within Farcaster, and its impact on decentralized social networking.
